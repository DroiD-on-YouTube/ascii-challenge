My solution is a haskell program, and will only have the correct timing when
run in ghci a macbook of the similar vintage as mine.   Assuming that you have
haskell installed on your computer, you can run my program by opening a 
terminal window in this folder, and typing the following commands 

```
ghci Main.hs
main
```

For the best results, you will need to resize the terminal window to at least
128 characters wide and 34 characters tall.

Enjoy.
